#### Result: 100% 
------------------------
 This is a project based on the game Bejewled which is a game that 
 initially displays a grid full of jewels . The player is allowed to swap 
 any jewel with the jewel to the left, right, above or below it.
 If you get 3 or more jewels in a row or in a column a match is detected
 and the jewels  disappear  from the display. The player gains a score for 
 each jewl matched.
 
 The player gets to choose their username, the number of games they want
 to play and the difficulty level of the game.
 
 Once the tournament is over the players score statistics are displayed to 
 the player - highest score, lowest score, average score and scores for 
 every game played.
